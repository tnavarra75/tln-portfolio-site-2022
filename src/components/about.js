        My path to frontend development may not have been linear, but my desire to learn and grow has been a constant. My first job out of college was in project management, my formal title was "traffic manager". Cue the comments about what the heck did that mean. Did I spend four years in college to learn how to direct cars? No dad...

        <br />
        I quickly found myself wanting to do the work I was managing so I taught myself the programs and convinced the studio manager to take a shot on me. Years later I can still cut foam core like a pro and have produced graphics for a wide variety of mediums.

        Over the years I developed an interest in code. I often contributed to the development group building emails and landing pages. In Jan of 2019 I was given the opportunity to spend six months doing development full time. That time solidified my desire to make the transition and once again I convinced a manager to take a chance on me. While my title didnâ€™t formally change until Jan of 2021 I have been working with the development group full time since July of 2020.
