        My path to frontend development may not have been linear, but my desire to learn and grow has been a constant. I got my start with Mullen (currently known as MullenLowe) as a Traffic Manager where I was surrounded by extraordinary Creative talent and learned by osmosis. As I grew in my craft, I pursued new avenues and opportunities within MullenLowe, including the Studio as a Production Artist for traditional mediums and Production Design for exclusively digital mediums.

        Today, I am a bit of a rare breed â€” a Frontend Developer that is half technical with the skills needed to work in a modern development environment and half creative with the ability to bring designs to life. It's been a wild and wonderful ride!
