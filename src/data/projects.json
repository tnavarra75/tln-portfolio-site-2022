The informational copy for each combination is dynamic as well as the content of the carousel lower on the page. There is also the ability to overlay hardware selections.</p><p>The filterable landing pages for style, color and hardware show a more traditional view. A compare tool on the style and color/finish pages allows the viewer to see selected styles side by side.</p>"
