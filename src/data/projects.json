The PDP detail page is a tool that allows the viewer to see what cabinet styles, material, and color/finish combinations are available. The informational copy for each combination is dynamic as well as the content of the carousel lower on the page. There is also the ability to overlay hardware selections. The filterable landing pages for style, color and hardware show a more traditional view. A compare tool on the style and color/finish pages allows the viewer to see selected styles side by side.</p>"

I set up a Strapi CMS to input and control which pre-written tweet messages correspond to each potential recipient.</p>"
